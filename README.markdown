# Duckworth for Campfire

So there you are, hanging out with your buddies on campfire. It's been kind of a crazy morning. The boss has been making demands that are starting to really get under your skin. You and your team split for lunch because collectively you guys are all like, whatev'.

You swing by Wendy's and order a medium fosty, a spicy chicken sandwich, and some fries (nice fucking choice right there friend). You eat that food like it was the last meal served on this very earth, savoring the goodness and leting the nutrients recharge your might. You and your buddy walk tall back to the shop, it's time to conquer the afternoon.

You walk into the office, have a seat, pull up the issues, and your new outlook crumbles. The boss spent all of lunch adding issues and assigning them to you. These ain't your typical issues either; I'm talking about IE6 bugs and JS errors. Shock turns to anger, anger to frustration, frustration to hopelessness. Then you hear a ding from Campfire.

Your face muscles are quickly freezing in an unfriendly shape as you switch tabs to see what your buddies have to say, when you see this...

And just like that, anger turns to happy because the butler from Ducktales is backing you up in Campfire.
